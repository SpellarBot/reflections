In the past week, I've done two middle school observations. They were both drastically different. The first was actually with two teachers. It reminded me a lot of my own middle school experience: it was horrible. The kids seemed to be kind of stuck, and the teachers didn't seem to enjoy their lives much. Their teaching definately reflected that. At times they seemed almost hostile. Not in a yelling way, but just in an extremely condescending way.

The second experience was almost a polar opposite. What I found particularly interesting was that the school was in a much "rougher" demographic, and was clearly less funded. Even with the limitations, the students seemed much happier. I was definately much happier to be there. I particularly liked how the teacher was able to level with the students, without fofeiting any authority.

I think different classes and situations require different teaching styles. I hope I will be able to adapt to the situation.
