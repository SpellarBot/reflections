This is an impressive article written by Stephen Wolfram. He created Wolfram Alpha,the Mathmatica programming language, and recently released the Wolfram programming language. This lengthy article talks about how we need to teach children how to think computationally. That is, how to organize information in a way that it can easily be put into a computer. He makes the point that essentially any occupation now has a "computational" subcategory, such as computational biology. So this will be more an more important in the coming years.
