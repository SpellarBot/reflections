My second high school visit was thankfully actually a high school visit. It was at maple mountain. That was a really impressive facility! I went to a photography class and they were learning some photoshop. Most of the time was lecture. The students seemed really engaged, probably because it was an elective class that they all wanted to be in. The teacher did a great job of not overcomplicating things. At the end he reviewed some students past work so it was cool to see what they had done, and the students seemed proud of their work as well.
