My work is starting a new program that will be a series of trainings intended to allow non developers to gain expereience and knowledge with programming. The attendees would be a wide range of people from support, to accounting and anything inbetween. They asked for volunteers from the development team, so I said I'd help out. I am eager to get the experience of teaching programming, if I taught in school that's what I'd like to teach. It will be fun to see how it goes and what challenges there are.
