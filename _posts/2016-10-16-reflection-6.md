My first high school visit was actually my third middle school visit. I went to freedom academy. It was a 7th grade class and they were doing sketchup. Most of the time was just them working on their projects. I really liked at the end of class though the teacher did an online quiz called "kahoot" (kahoot.it). It's just a website and you can log in and compete against other students. Your username can be whatever you want so it's semi anonymous if some students are uncomfortable competing publicly. It was just a really easy way to review content, and it was really fun! The kids got way into it. I'm totally going to remember that website!
