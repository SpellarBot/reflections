For this reading I found this article: http://techintheclass.blogspot.com/2008/05/teachers-are-professionals.html

It talks about how teachers need to be professional on social media and protect their image. This article is from 2009, so social media is an even bigger factor now than it was 7 years ago. As my generation begins teaching, I wonder if students will start following and friending us? I think it's valuable to think about that now. I would probably allow my students to follow me, but I'll have to be careful what I post.
