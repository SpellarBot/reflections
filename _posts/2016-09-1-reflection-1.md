Today in class we talked about teaching philosophies. That's something that I previously had never considered. I really really enjoyed the discussion though. Essentially a teaching philosophy is _how_ are you going to teach? I think the upcoming generation will be even less conformist and authoritarian than our generation is, so it's important the be conscious of what teaching style I will employ. Different subjects will require different styles, and different students will require different styles. It's important to never just do something because that's how you've always done it, so I hope I can always reflect and reinvent myself and my teaching to be most effective.
