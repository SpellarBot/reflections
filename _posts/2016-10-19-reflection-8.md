This week I was thinking about classroom debates. Several students used that in their teachings on Monday. I also had a class that did that a few weeks ago. For some reason, I get very intense during debates so it may just be that I have a hard time with them. However, that made me ponder debates and their effectiveness. My argument is that a true debate is actually really hard to do. Look at the presidential debates, it's a complete joke, and they are supposedly some of the most qualified people in the country to debate. I think there are similar techniques that could be used that might be more effective generally. Not that debates are bad, but it could be better. I had the though of doing a persuasive paper on a topic and being assigned a position. I also thought of doing a "town hall" style debate, where the teacher is debating the classroom. I think my biggest problem with a debate is that the loudest voices are usually the ones that win, but just because you're loud doesn't mean you know what you're talking about.
