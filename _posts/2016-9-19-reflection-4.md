This is an interesting article written by the parent of a girl taking a CS class in high school. There is some good feedback in the article. I think a lot of it is easier said than done, but it's all a valid perspective. If I teach in a school setting, this is something I would have to be aware of and actively work for. I hope I can teach all genders in a way that is supportive and helpful.
