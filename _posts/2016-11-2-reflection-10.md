As we end our individual teaching experiences, it's been interesting to reflect on the comparison between the earlier ones and the later ones. Oddly enough, I think overall class enthusiasm for the teachings has decreased somewhat, I know mine has. I've noticed quite a few people are not in class. I wonder if that's just the time of the semester, or if people don't feel like it's important to be there? I've been late several times myself. It seems like enthusiasm peaked around the second or third day of presentations. I also think it's interesting how many people have very similar teaching ideas (getting into groups, debates, etc). I wonder if that's just because our generation enjoys those more, or because we develope a group think mentality? I have been impressed with the overall quality of the teachings though, so that's inspiring. It will be fun to see what comes next!
